# vinyl-record-database
This project started as a way to catalog and organize my ever-growing collection of vinyl records. I wanted to keep track of money spent as well as what I currently own to avoid duplicate purchases.

Current Features
- Creating new artists and bands
- Creating new database entries

## Used Technologies
Some HTML with a PHP form is used to collect record information from the user. It connects to a <a href="https://www.mysql.com">MySQL</a> database to store the information. 

I use <a href="https://www.mamp.info/en/mac/">MAMP</a> for macOS (Apple Silicon) as the PHP server. <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio Code</a> for code development.

## Future Development
Future Features
- Modify function for artists, records, and Owners.
- Allow visualization of tables such as catalog, artists, Owners

I plan to transition this project from being PHP-based in a browser window to a Java-based GUI. Any tips regarding Java integration with my existing DB would be greatly appreciated.

## Bugs and Suggestions
I'm definitely open to suggestions and want to know of areas that can be improved.
